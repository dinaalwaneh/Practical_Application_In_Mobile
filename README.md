# Practical_Application_In_Mobile

I have two solutions in the web view Assignment . The first is three pages where you can navigate between them through buttons. The second method is a single page, and the view of the page you want can be controlled by using the isvisible property.

Ps: I put the code of the second solution in which I used the is visible property inside the solution of the first method as a comment.
